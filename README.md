The first 50 entries of this list are based on the huge work of the Zcash Community.

You can find the original post here: https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/list-of-all-privacy-coins-projects/33159

The CSV is generated from this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e9a6aWkt7pzKt71iNUwDYkAJ4-tfRVmGJieLtXCoN3c/edit?usp=sharing


# Future work
- Find better source that the spreadsheet
- Complete the details for each project
- Convert the raw csv to markdown for a better browser experience
